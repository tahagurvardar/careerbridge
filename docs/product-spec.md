# CareerBridge product specification

## Product vision

CareerBridge is a job and internship platform that gives candidates a clearer route to meaningful work and gives hiring teams a more structured way to find, evaluate, and support talent.

The product should feel trustworthy, focused, and useful before any AI capability is introduced. AI will later improve relevance and drafting assistance, but the core experience must remain complete, understandable, and operable without it.

## Problem statement

Candidates often split their career information, opportunity discovery, and application tracking across disconnected tools. Recruiters face inconsistent candidate information, noisy pipelines, and limited visibility into process health. Platform operators need reliable moderation and analytics without resorting to opaque workflows.

CareerBridge brings these activities into one role-aware system with shared domain concepts and explicit status transitions.

## User roles

### Candidate

- Create and maintain a professional profile
- Add education, experience, and skills
- Upload and manage a CV
- Search and filter jobs and internships
- Save opportunities
- Apply for roles
- Track application status and history

### Recruiter

- Create and maintain a company profile
- Create, edit, publish, and close job listings
- Review applicants and candidate profiles
- Access candidate CVs when authorized
- Update application statuses
- View recruitment workflow analytics

### Admin

- Manage users, companies, listings, and reports
- Review platform-level analytics
- Moderate content and respond to trust and safety concerns
- Audit important platform actions

## MVP scope

The initial product MVP is expected to include:

1. Role-based account creation and secure sessions
2. Candidate profile, education, experience, skill, and CV management
3. Company profiles and recruiter membership
4. Job listing lifecycle and public discovery
5. Saved jobs and application submission
6. Candidate and recruiter application tracking
7. Basic admin moderation and operational views
8. Essential product analytics and audit records

## Current phase: foundation

Phase 0 establishes only the technical and visual foundation:

- Next.js App Router application and shared public layout
- Responsive light and dark themes
- Public marketing and route placeholders
- Owned shadcn/ui primitives
- PostgreSQL-ready Prisma configuration
- Documentation, scripts, and quality gates

Authentication, domain models, file upload, applications, dashboards, notifications, messaging, analytics collection, and AI features are outside Phase 0.

## Future AI scope

Potential AI-assisted capabilities include:

- Candidate-to-job match scoring with explainable factors
- CV structure and content analysis
- Cover-letter drafting grounded in the candidate and job
- Recruiter-facing summarization and comparison aids

AI product requirements:

- No autonomous hiring or rejection decisions
- Clear disclosure whenever AI is used
- User review before generated content is submitted
- Explainable signals rather than unexplained scores
- Data minimization, retention controls, and auditability
- Evaluation for bias, quality, safety, and failure modes before release

## Product quality requirements

- Keyboard-accessible workflows and visible focus treatment
- Responsive layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Designed empty, loading, validation, error, and success states
- Clear ownership and authorization for every protected action
- Consistent status language and traceable state transitions
- No fabricated production data in public previews

## Success signals

Quantitative targets will be defined once real workflows and analytics exist. Early success should be assessed through:

- Candidate profile completion and application completion
- Search-to-save and search-to-application conversion
- Recruiter time from publication to first qualified review
- Application status freshness and candidate visibility
- Accessibility, reliability, and performance quality gates
